This will focus on a predictive maintenance problem. The business challenge is brought by www.drivendata.org and the goal is to predict the operation state (functional, repair needed, not failure) of water pumps in Tanzania. The water pump data is provided by taarifa.org an organization that provides people the ability to report water and sanitation problems in Africa. Here is a dashboard of the status of water points in Tanzania: http://dashboard.taarifa.org/#/dashboard.
